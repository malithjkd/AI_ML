# AI_ML Learning Materials


## Introduction

Cousera course of [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) work.


## Instructions to run 

To run the differant packages with python we need to install conda.
conda commands.


## Required conda package list

* [NumPY](https://numpy.org/install/)
* Matplotlib
